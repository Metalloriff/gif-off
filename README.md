# Description
Gif Off is an interactive game in which users are presented with a randomly selected question from a set of predefined packs. Players must select a GIF image from Tenor as the most suitable response to the question. Once all responses have been submitted, users vote on the best response, and are rewarded with points for each vote they receive.

# NOTE

# TODO
Add a low chance to request a question from a random player
Add bots - The bots will allow less than 3 players to play together by auto-filling random gifs as response to each question. Voting for a bot would throw the vote away, making it possible to play with less than 3 players.
Add tag guidelines - This will force whatever tag guidelines the host decides to be inserted into every gif search the user does.
Add timers
